                    <a href="https://smartcricket.com/"> Smart Cricket </a> (previously Speculur) was first ideated in
                    2015 and their goal was to capture data of
                    cricket shots. That idea was developed in the form of a cricket bat sensor (Batsense) and a <a
                        href="https://apps.apple.com/au/app/smartcricket-batsense/id1466040462"> mobile
                        app </a> which they showcased at the <a
                        href="https://www.icc-cricket.com/champions-trophy/news/406202"> 2017 ICC Champions Trophy </a>
                    in England and Wales. They then officially
                    launched in 2019 and was used during the <a

                        ICC Cricket World Cup </a>. So how did does it all work and what
                    does it do for a Batsman?

                    The Batsense sensor is an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) that captures acceleration, angular rate
                    and orientation (magnetometer). It can be attached to the end of a cricket bat using a sleeve that
                    acts as an interface. A batsman can install Batsense onto any cricket bat and turn that into a
                    ‘Smart Bat’. Once the sensor is in place and connected to the Batsense smartphone app, the batsman
                    can start hitting and collecting data. The sensor tracks metrics such as Impact time, angles (back
                    lift angle, follow through angle, bat start angle, impact angle, blade angle), speeds (max bat
                    speed, average bat speed, speed at impact), rotation at impact and shot efficiency. These metrics
                    coupled with video footage of the shot and a 3D visualisation (avatar) of the motion helps identify
                    where the batsman is strong at and where they can improve. The app also comes with various features
                    to facilitate coaching and monitoring of player performance throughout trainings and matches.

                    Since launching in 2019, they have sold over 10,000 units worldwide, and they have even developed
                    <a href="https://smartcricket.com/smart-stumps-broadcast-solution"> Smart Stumps </a> that can
                    collect data from the Batsense and broadcast that data real-time during a
                    match. Going forward, the team at Smart Cricket are committed to expand their range of sensor
                    technology to bring more insights into the game and help level up the performance of budding
                    cricketers while reducing the risk of injuries. Some of those wearable technologies in their <a

                <p>
                    Ever since <a href="https://valdperformance.com/forcedecks/"> ForceDecks </a> became part of <a
                        href="https://valdperformance.com/"> Vald Performance </a> in 2018, they have been making lots
                    of little
                    improvements to make performance measures easier and better. Just over a year ago, they released the
                    <a href="https://sportstechnologyblog.com/2021/02/08/top-5-sports-tech-news-jan-2021/"> ForceDecks
                        Mini </a> to offer an ultra-portable solution so it’s easier to bring it around. This year,
                    they have integrated video capture into their ForceDeck iPad app so that users (physios, exercise
                    scientists, etc) can easily record the athlete’s movement, posture and joint angles, and review it
                    in relation to the ground reaction forces (GRF) data from the ForceDecks dual force plates.
                </p>

                <p>
                    It may seem like a simple add-on, but the benefits are really significant. Firstly, syncing video
                    and force plate data is not always straightforward. ForceDecks has not only done that, but they have
                    incorporated computer vision algorithms to identify and annotate key moments and phases of the
                    assessments/measures. So when it comes to reviewing the assessment and giving feedback to the
                    athlete, the exercise scientist can quickly jump to the specific annotated key moments instead of
                    trying to manually scroll through the video to find them. Secondly, having visual reference of the
                    athlete’s movement, side-by-side with the data helps provide better context to the athlete and helps
                    keep them engaged. One additional thing Vald Performance has done is developed a wireless adapter
                    for the older ForceDecks models so that users of those models can also utilise this new iPad
                    feature. Read more about ForceDecks Vision here: <a href="https://valdperformance.com/vision/"> link

                    <a href="https://valdhealth.com/"> Vald Health </a> is a division of <a href="https://vald.com/">
                        Vald</a> which has developed and acquired various movement measurement and
                    monitoring tech products including the Nordbord (hamstring testing), ForceFrame (strength testing),
                    HumanTrak (movement analysis), TeleHab (exercise prescription) and ForceDecks (dual force plate
                    system). All these products can be applied in a sports performance setting, which is what <a

                    which is
                    the realm of a Vald Health. That is quite often the case with sports tech products -> they typically
                    can swing over to work in allied health applications, and health tech products can sometimes cross
                    over to sports applications.

                <p>
                    In 2018, <a href="https://www.mccullough.com.au/client_results/vald-performance-pty-ltd/"> Vald acquired NMP Technologies</a>, the makers of ForceDecks, a dual force plate system for
                    evaluating neuromuscular performance. One of the key features (or differentiation) of this dual
                    force plate system (compared to other force plate systems in the market) is the ability to measure
                    forces of each limb/foot of an athlete individually and therefore the ability to quantify left-right
                    asymmetries during jump, isometrics, squat measures etc. The system also comes with software that
                    quickly processes, analyses and presents the key metrics for every test/measure. There were
                    previously already 2 versions of the hardware – the ForceDecks Max and the ForceDecks Lite which is
                    smaller in terms of weight and area of measure. More recently, Vald Health has launched the
                    ForceDecks Mini to offer an even more portable solution to allied health or rehabilitation
                    specialists. Weighing only 5kg per plate and packed in a small carry case, this makes the Mini
                    system easier for physiotherapists to bring assessments to their clients – whether its offsite
                    testings or even home visits for older clients. At the same time, the Mini maintains the same
                    sampling rate (1000Hz) as the larger systems and supported by the same software so practitioners can
                    lean on its accuracy and reliability. Find out more on their website here: <a href="https://valdhealth.com/fdmini/"> link</a>.
